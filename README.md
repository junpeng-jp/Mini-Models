# Mini Models in PyTorch & TensorFlow

The pace of advancement in deep learning technologies is incredible with new innovations pushing benchmarks in the areas of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and many other fields. 

To kickstart my Journey into machine learning, I will be implementing models in PyTorch and Tensorflow based on the various papers by researchers in the field.

## Scaled Down Models 
As the models will be for implementation practice, we will only build tiny models that can be trained quickly.

## 30 Epoch Training Only
All implemented models will be trained for only 30 Epochs to demonstrate that it works
